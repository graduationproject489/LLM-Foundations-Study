### **a) Taxonomy Figure**
The **Taxonomy Figure** provides a high-level visual overview of the various components of the LLM ecosystem. It organizes LLM families, architectures, models, and applications into a coherent diagram, giving you a clear picture of how different elements within the field interact and relate to one another.

- **What it shows:**  
  - A breakdown of LLM families (e.g., GPT, BERT, T5)
  - Key architectural components (e.g., attention mechanisms, neural networks)
  - Interconnections between LLM models and their applications in different domains

- **Why it’s useful:**  
  - This visual aid is perfect for anyone new to the field, offering a high-level view of how the different LLM subfields interact.
  - Researchers and students can use the figure to quickly grasp the full scope of LLM models and concepts without being overwhelmed by detail.

### **b) PRISMA Diagram**
The **PRISMA Diagram** visually represents the methodology we used to conduct the systematic review of research papers for this repository. We adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to ensure a transparent, reproducible process in selecting and including studies that contribute to the LLM landscape.

- **What it shows:**  
  - The steps followed to select papers, from search strategies and screening criteria to final inclusion.
  - Visual steps in the review process, such as paper selection, exclusions, and relevant data extraction.

- **Why it’s useful:**  
  - This diagram offers insights into the **systematic review process**, making it valuable for researchers wanting to understand how studies were selected for inclusion.
  - It ensures transparency, making it easier for others to follow and replicate the methodology used to gather and curate the research in this repository.

### **c) Research Log**
The **Research Log** is an essential tool for tracking and documenting the papers reviewed in this repository. This **Excel file** organizes papers by key metadata, including:
- Citation count
- Relevance to specific subfields in LLM research
- Key themes and findings


### **In Summary**
The **Assets** folder provides valuable resources for both theoretical understanding and practical insight into the landscape of LLMs:
- **Taxonomy Figure:** Organizes the LLM ecosystem visually, offering an accessible introduction to the field.
- **PRISMA Diagram:** Illustrates the systematic approach used in selecting papers, enhancing transparency in the research process.
- **Research Log:** Tracks and details the research papers reviewed, serving as a reference and guide for future studies.
