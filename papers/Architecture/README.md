## **Architectures**

The **Architectures** folder contains research papers that dive into the different architectural approaches, advancements, and design choices in Large Language Models (LLMs). These studies explore everything from foundational architectures like **Transformers** to more advanced concepts in **scaling**, **prefix-tuning**, and **decoder-only architectures**. If you're interested in understanding the evolving design principles that power modern LLMs, this section will provide essential readings.

### **Included Papers**

1. **[Attention Is All You Need](<https://user.phil.hhu.de/~cwurm/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf>)**  
   - This paper introduced the **Transformer Architecture**, a groundbreaking approach in deep learning that uses self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence or convolutions to process sequences. The transformer has become the basis for many advanced LLMs such as GPT and BERT. This paper explains the core ideas behind attention mechanisms and how they revolutionized language modeling.

2. **[Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation](<link-to-paper>)**  
   - In this study, prefix-tuning is proposed as a method for optimizing continuous prompts, providing a scalable approach for improving the generation capabilities of LLMs. By fine-tuning the pre-trained transformer models with a set of continuous input prompts, this approach achieves performance improvements in text generation tasks.

3. **[On Decoder-Only Architecture For Speech-to-Text and Large Language Model Integration](<link-to-paper>)**  
   - This paper discusses the **decoder-only architectures** for speech-to-text models and the integration of these architectures with LLMs, advancing the intersection between speech processing and language models. It provides insights into the architectureâ€™s suitability for various multimodal applications.

4. **[Comparative Study of Large Language Model Architectures on Frontier](<link-to-paper>)**  
   - This research provides a comparative analysis of the architectures of modern LLMs, comparing leading models' strengths and weaknesses across a variety of
