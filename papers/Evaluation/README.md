## **Evaluation**

The **Evaluation** folder compiles essential research papers focused on assessing the performance, capabilities, and limitations of **Large Language Models** (LLMs). These studies highlight key metrics, evaluation strategies, and methodologies for analyzing various aspects of LLMs, including reasoning ability, code generation, consistency, and summarization. For anyone interested in the critical aspects of model evaluation, this folder will provide valuable insights and frameworks.
